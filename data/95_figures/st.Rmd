Figure S4.  Transcription Factor Family Enrichment in Select DEG Modules. Enrichment for transcription factor was determined in both the cold_up (A) and heat_up (B) bulk and module-assigned differentially expressed gene lists. Numbers in parentheses indicate group size, while numbers in tiles indicate how many DEGs of specific transcription factor families were identified in each module. Enrichment was determined through hypergeometric testing (p < 0.05), and enrichment was not considered for modules with fewer than 3 TFs in a given family. Transcription factor family assignments were pulled from Grassius TFDB (ref).
